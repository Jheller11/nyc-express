Codepen for developing list style: https://codepen.io/jheller11/pen/WYePve?editors=1100

# Next Steps

1. reconfig models, data => store items under each user, create "friends" property for users, on request for items from server load owned items plus items from friends. Only owner can edit or delete item.

2. config like functionality => push user into array, total derived from array.length

3. Add map functionality =>

   - short term: link to google maps url with location/name search
   - long term: create my own map which can be viewed with all items instead of list view (color coded markers, filters, etc.)

4. User profile page

5. Make edits to User, password recovery, etc.

6. Yelp

7. Read data from link when creating new item?

8. finalize authentication, verify user, restrict routes

9. Expand test coverage
